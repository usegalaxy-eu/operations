# Traefik

[Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/v3.0/) is used as a reverse proxy, certificate manager and loadbalancer for `sn09` and `sn07`.
It is deployed using an [ansible-playbook](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/infrastructure-playbook/pull/1257) which uses [usegalaxy-eu's Traefik role](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/ansible-Traefik). This role internally initializes a swarm cluster on the target host, creates secrets, the specified network and docker swarm services.
Docker swarm was used for mainly two reasons:
1. Secret handling: Secrets are not saved inside env files, but are encrypted on disk and only available to the container they are attached to.
2. Scalability and future failover safe deployments: By using Docker swarm you can quite easily add a second proxy node and use e.g. [keepalived](https://www.keepalived.org/) as ingress.
3. Features: Traefik comes with many options for middlewares and Plugins. If you would like, for instance, to block certain IP ranges, this could be easily done using a [plugin](https://plugins.traefik.io/plugins).

## Basics
|                    |                             |
| ------------------ | --------------------------  |
| Default user       | `rocky`                     |
| IP                 | `132.230.103.37`            |
| Host               | `traefik.galaxyproject.eu`  |
| Traefiks logs      | `/var/log/traefik`          |

To have a pretty output use `hl`:
~~~
sudo ./hl /var/log/traefik/traefik./glog --follow
~~~
The machine is a ESXi VM. The University provides this fancy [dashboard](https://vcsa-rz.intra.uni-freiburg.de/). Log in with your university handle and password.
### Docker swarm basics
`docker service ls` shows the "services" which are similar to the ones in kubernetes.
`docker service rm` deletes the service and all its respective containers, in case you would like to start from clean slate.
`docker service logs` would not work with Traefik, because it writes directly to `/var/log/traefik`


## New subdomains
To add new subdomains, add a new line to the file `files/traefik/rules/template-subdomains.yml` in the [infrastructure-playbook](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/infrastructure-playbook) repo. The language there is a `go` template for a `yaml` file, which might look similar to ansible at first. (In case you wonder about the syntax).
The line should look like the ones above, like this scheme:
~~~
{{template "subdomain" "<your-subdomain-name>"}}
~~~
Be careful, the word `subdomain` in the second colum needs to stay literaly "subdomain", only the 3rd column is changed to the new subdomain, but without any `.usegalaxy.eu`.
Once this is deployed, Traefik will automatically create a router for it and fetch certificates for the subdomain as well as a wildcard certificate for ITs.
If you did everything correctly, the new router appears on Traefik's [dashboard](https://traefik.springhare-dinosaur.ts.net/dashboard/#/).

## How to debug
### ðŸš‘ Galaxy not reachable
In order to bridge the debug time, you can install HAProxy on Traefik and try [this config](https://gist.github.com/meanevo/f962a8fa5763862ab6cd94addbc4dd8d)
### usegalaxy.eu /subdomain is showing a plain `404 not found`
Most likely something happened to the router.
- Check the [dashboard](https://traefik.springhare-dinosaur.ts.net/dashboard/#/) via tailscale
- If all routers look fine, check if something happened to the rulefile in `files/traefik/rules/` `usegalaxy-eu-router.yml` for usegalaxy.eu and `template-subdomains.yml` for subdomains. Take a close look at the `HostRegexp` rule.
- Less likely: check that the `servers` in `usegalaxy-eu-service.yml` are correct and reachable.
### `Bad Gateway` error
- One headnode unhealthy? You can test with e.g. `sn07.galaxyproject.eu` directly. Traefik should automatically skip unhealth hosts, see the [dashboard](https://traefik.springhare-dinosaur.ts.net/dashboard/#/) and [docs](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/v3.0/routing/services/#health-check)
- Can be faulty certificates. When checked everything else, make a backup of `/etc/traefik/acme.json` and delete all its contents (not the file itself), then restart Traefik using `docker restart <Traefik container name>`
- Service configuration might be faulty: check `usegalaxy-eu-service.yml`

### `no available server`
This could mean that either
- both headnodes are down
- Traefik was unable to get a response when doing the [healthCheck](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/v3.0/routing/services/#health-check)
- in the latter case, check if the DNS inside the container works. If it fails, tailscale might be the issue.
~~~
sudo tailscale up --accept-dns=false --advertise-tags=tag:critical
docker restart <Traefik container name>
~~~
This should not be necessary, because it is set in `group_vars/all.yml`

### Self signed certificate warning
Could only appear when many certs have to be fetched newly at the same time.
`AWS route53` has a harsh rate limit of 5 req/s, if Traefik tries to create and check the `TXT records` during `DNS-01 challenge` for all subdomains, this could result in >100 req/s. It will take some time and Traefik will get more and more certs. If you see error messages after 1h, you can try to restart Traefik.
### Letsencrypt i/o error
Probably a egress issue with Docker networks. Recreating the bridge helped:
~~~
# systemctl stop docker
# iptables -t net -F
# ip link set docker0 down
# brctl delbr br100
# systemctl start docker
~~~
