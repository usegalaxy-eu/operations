# [Infrastructure Playbook repository](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/infrastructure-playbook)

## Generic introduction
* This repository contains the [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) playbooks, roles, etc for the European Galaxy server. It is used to deploy the infrastructure for the European Galaxy server through [Jenkins](https://build.galaxyproject.eu/job/usegalaxy-eu/). All configurational changes related to the [Galaxy EU](https://usegalaxy.eu) are made through this repository.
* Galaxy EU compute infrastructure is run on the [BW OpenStack cloud](https://portal.bw-cloud.org/). At the time of writing (21/02/2023) our cloud is of size 8488 VCPUs, 44.6 TB RAM, 162.6 TB storage. Additionally, a few petabytes of [storage](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/operations/blob/main/storage.md) is also mounted (NFS) in the cloud.
* The compute infrastructure (cloud cluster) is configured through [VGCN infrastructure repo](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/vgcn-infrastructure) where we define what [cloud images](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/vgcn) should be used, the size of the cloud cluster, the number of VMs, the cloud network, the cloud security groups, etc.
* The cloud is configured through this [infrastructure repo](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/infrastructure) using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). The underlying cloud hardware, storage, network, etc are managed by the compute center of the University of Freiburg. For DNS records we use [Amazon's Route53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/).
* Some documentation related to [services](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/operations/blob/main/cloud/services.md) and IT operations are available in this [operations repo](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/operations)
* For Galaxy Admin training you can refer [here](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/admin/)
* For monitoring of the Galaxy EU infrastructure we use [Grafana](https://grafana.com/). The dashboards are available [here](https://stats.galaxyproject.eu/)

## Ansible
* [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) is an open-source software provisioning, configuration management, and application-deployment tool enabling infrastructure as code.
* The basic components of Ansible can be found [here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/network/getting_started/basic_concepts.html). Understanding this is important to understand this repo.

## Our repo structure
* [files](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/infrastructure-playbook/tree/master/files): contains files/configs that are used by the playbooks/roles
* [group_vars](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/infrastructure-playbook/tree/master/group_vars) and [host_vars](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/infrastructure-playbook/tree/master/host_vars): contains variables that are used by the playbooks specific to certain host/group defined in the [inventory file](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/infrastructure-playbook/blob/master/hosts). For every playbook we have an associated group_vars/host_vars file where we define the variables that are used by the playbook and the roles that are included/imported in the playbook.
* [roles](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/infrastructure-playbook/tree/master/roles): contains the roles that are included/imported in the playbooks. The roles contain a set of tasks to configure a host to serve a certain purpose like configuring a service.
* [secret_group_vars](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/infrastructure-playbook/tree/master/secret_group_vars): This is our vault. It contains the passwords and other sensitive information that is used by the playbooks/roles. The files are encrypted using [Ansible Vault](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html).
* [templates](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/infrastructure-playbook/tree/master/templates): contains the templates that are used by the playbooks/roles. The templates are used to generate the final configuration files that are used by the services. The templates are written in [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) syntax.
* [ansible.cfg](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/infrastructure-playbook/blob/master/ansible.cfg): contains the configuration of Ansible. This is used to define the location of the inventory file, the vault password file, etc.
* [hosts](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/infrastructure-playbook/blob/master/hosts): contains the inventory of the hosts that are managed by Ansible.

## Playbooks
The playbooks are located in the [root directory](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/infrastructure-playbook) of the repo.

  ## Roles
Our locally maintained Ansible roles are located in the [roles directory](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/infrastructure-playbook/tree/master/roles). Also, we maintain several other roles and all of them are in their own github repositories and can be found in our [organization](https://github.com/orgs/usegalaxy-eu/repositories). Most of these roles are published on [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/usegalaxy_eu). In addition to our roles we also use roles from the [galaxyproject](https://galaxy.ansible.com/galaxyproject) All the roles (non-local) we use are listed in our [requirements.yaml](https://github.com/usegalaxy-eu/infrastructure-playbook/blob/master/requirements.yaml) file. These roles can be installed by running the following command:

    ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yaml
